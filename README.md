> <hr>

### Description

This project introduces a concurrent application for information retrieval, using the [Standard Boolean Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Boolean_model). 
More precisely, this implementation offers the possibility of parallel query processing, over the [Cranfield Collection](http://ir.dcs.gla.ac.uk/resources/test_collections/cran/) of text documents, using **Atomic Memory Transactions** implemented in **C++**.
